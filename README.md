## tessel-projects

Tessel 2 workspace based on blog from Rick Waldron on using 
[Johnny-Five with Tessel 2](https://bocoup.com/weblog/say-hello-world-with-johnny-five-on-tessel-2) 
but I will be adding more over time (e.g. 7segment.js).

Clone this repo, then run npm install.

You can run the following to deploy on your Tessel

    t2 run blink.js
    t2 run rainbow.js
    t2 run 7segment.js
    t2 run larson.js
    t2 run 7segment.js
